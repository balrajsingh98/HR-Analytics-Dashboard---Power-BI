"Analyzing Workforce Attrition: Insights for Retention Strategies through Power BI"

Why: This project aims to understand key factors behind employee attrition by analyzing data on age, gender, education, salary, tenure, and job roles. By leveraging Power BI for interactive dashboards and analytics, the project helps identify trends and areas where companies can implement effective retention strategies, ultimately reducing turnover and improving workforce stability.

key insights based on the data provided. Here's a breakdown of potential factors that might be driving attrition:

1. Age Group (18-25):
The majority of the employees are young, between 18-25 years old. Younger employees often seek career growth or may feel dissatisfaction if they don't see quick progress, leading to higher turnover.
2. Job Roles:
Sales Representatives and Laboratory Technicians appear frequently. Sales roles often experience high pressure, commission-based salaries, and potential burnout, while Laboratory Technicians in Research & Development might face dissatisfaction from a lack of growth opportunities or challenging work environments.
3. Education Level:
Many employees have technical degrees or backgrounds in life sciences or medical fields. If their skills are underutilized or the job does not match expectations, this mismatch can cause frustration and contribute to attrition.
4. Marital Status:
A significant portion of employees are single. Single employees may have more flexibility to leave jobs without the constraints of family responsibilities, which can lead to increased mobility and higher attrition.
5. Income Level (Upto 5k):
A majority of employees have salaries "up to 5k." Low pay can be a strong factor in employees seeking better opportunities elsewhere, especially in high-demand fields like sales and research.
6. Travel Frequency:
Most employees report "Travel_Rarely" or "Non-Travel." Some employees may desire more flexible work arrangements, such as remote work or travel opportunities, which could influence their decision to leave.
7. Job Satisfaction and Environment:
While satisfaction isn't explicitly mentioned, a large percentage of employees work in Research & Development, which can be demanding. Research-related roles might face funding cuts, long hours, or slow progress in career development.
8. Job Tenure and Promotion Opportunities:
Employees who have been in their roles for extended periods without significant promotion opportunities are more likely to feel stagnant, which could be contributing to the high attrition in certain roles.
By focusing on improving compensation, offering clearer career progression, and enhancing work-life balance, companies can address these common factors to reduce attrition.
